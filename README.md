# Chromium - Firefox Custom Browser Log

Here is Lunatrix's log for their creation of custom Chrome and Firefox browser aesthetics.

Hi there! This isn't much of a repository where you would expect to find code or any software downloads but rather a access points for my works on customizing and
optimizing the experiences you can have with your Chrome/Edge or Firefox browsers. 

You might know Firefox mostly for their touted privacy methods over the competition. However, Firefox is equally as known for the ability to freely customize the 
browser to your liking down to the basic roots, much like what is touted for in the Android OS ecosystem. From customizing the homepage to the endless amounts of 
extensions one at home can make, the possibilites are endless (and really cute) for those looking into making Firefox their own. Same goes with Chrome. 

This repository will be a mix of both extensions and aesthetic changes created by me, Lunatrix (also Sinodal for those who knew me back then as that), and their 
links to support my work.
